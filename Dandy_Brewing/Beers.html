          light, refreshing, with a touch of spice and saison character. Brewed

          character for a rich sour experience.

        <p>6.5% ABV</p>

        <p>Winter</p>

        <p>
          A fruity Black IPA. With only a kiss of roast, this black IPA is fresh
          and juicy but dark as the coldest days of winter. Citra and Mosaic are
          late hop additions to avoid the bitterness and focus on aroma.

        <p>
          An homage to the classic Tiki cocktail. This beer has notes of

        <p>5.5% ABV</p>

        <p>Summer</p>

        <p>
          English Summer Ale. A style developed during a late 70’s heat wave in
          England, this beer is designed to refresh in the hot summer sun. Dry,
          with a touch of wheat and toasted Victory malt, it is balanced with a
          touch of bitterness and a sweet citrus aroma. Patios, BBQ’s, and
          friends all pair perfectly with this beer!
