                    <em>"This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)"</em> is a song
                    by new wave band Talking Heads, released in November 1983 as
                    the second single from their fifth album Speaking in
                    Tongues. The lyrics were written by David Byrne, and the
                    music was written by Byrne and the other members of the
                    band, Chris Frantz, Tina Weymouth and Jerry Harrison.

                  <p class="second_para">
                    In the "Self Interview" on the DVD of the concert film Stop
                    Making Sense, Byrne states that it is a love song, a topic
                    he tends to avoid because it is "kinda big." He also said of
                    the song:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    That's a love song made up almost completely of non
                    sequiturs, phrases that may have a strong emotional
                    resonance but don't have any narrative qualities. It's a
                    real honest kind of love song. I don't think I've ever done
                    a real love song before. Mine always had a sort of
                    reservation, or a twist. I tried to write one that wasn't
                    corny, that didn't sound stupid or lame the way many do. I
                    think I succeeded; I was pretty happy with that.<sup
